## Technical details

This MCP is built using [MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) for Python from Anthropic.
It uses FastMCP to implement tools offered by the MCP server.

This MCP server consumes two Microsoft APIs / frameworks:

- [Azure Bot Builder](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-python) for python
- [Microsoft Graph SDK](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-python) for python

Azure Bot Builder allows a bot (Microsoft Entra ID app) to consume a Microsoft REST API to send messages to channels 
(but it is not capable of consuming messages because the bot is not deployed in Azure). The REST API client is 
encapsulated inside the framework classes, and it is not used directly.
In order to send messages without actually being deployed in Azure, the bot "continues" a conversation to retrieve 
the TurnContext instance and perform actions on "activities". This technique is called 
[proactive messaging](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/conversations/send-proactive-messages?tabs=python)

Replying to messages through bot builder is not possible without the help of 
[this hack](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-sdk/issues/6626), because the bot builder framework 
is not ready for this use (although the internal REST API allows it, and it works like a charm).

Azure Bot Builder allows to perform any write operation, but reading messages or previous threads is not possible 
without a special "migration" permission. Because of that, we have preferred to use Microsoft Graph to read messages.
Microsoft Application Entra ID must have been granted permissions to read messages in a channel.
